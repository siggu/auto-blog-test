As if OpenAI didn’t have enough

drama around the Super Bowl and advertising

, as the game wound down, word spread of a “leaked” ad that actually wasn’t leaked at all; it was just a fake. Screenshots of a

told the tale of a frustrated employee who, while posting about how upset they were because the ad they’d worked on didn’t run, accidentally leaked the

New York’s state legislature is set to consider a pair of bills that would require labels on

AI-generated content

and would put a

three-year pause

new data center construction

The New York Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Requirements in News Act (

NY FAIR News Act

, for short) would require that any news “substantially composed, authored, or created through the use of generative artificial intelligence” carry a disclaimer.
